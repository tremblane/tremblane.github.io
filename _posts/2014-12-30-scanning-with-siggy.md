title: Scanning With Siggy
---

(this post assumes you understand the mechanics of how to do things in siggy, such as editing connections in the chain map or editing a signature in the signature list; this is not a tutorial on how to use siggy; these are instructions on how to use siggy more better and be less bad)

# General Use (how to be good)

Short version: Never not constantly use the Mass Sig Reader. Using the Mass Sig Reader tool you can only add information; pasting in less information than what is in siggy will not erase things. If somebody else has full details about a signature entered in siggy and you paste in a partial signature (only the type, or no details), then it will ignore your update and leave the details there. Multiple people can be scanning a system and pasting in information at the same time.

Long version: As you are scanning a system you should constantly be updating siggy with the information collected. The simplest way to do this is by using the **Mass Sig Reader** tool. Click on any of the signatures in your Probe Scanner window and press control-a (to select all the signatures) then control-c (to copy). Then in siggy click the Mass Sig Reader button. Paste into the text box that opens and click submit. After a couple of seconds siggy will update the signature list with any new signatures, and update any previously added signatures that you have more details on. You can also input data for individual signatures by selecting a single signature in the Probe Scanner window, copying it, and pasting it into the **Signature Adder** box. While not a wrong way to do things, using the Mass Sig Reader will capture any new signatures that have appeared since the last mass read. In summary, you should never have to enter data from your probe scanner window into siggy without using the Mass Sig Reader or the Signature Adder.

tl;dr

 1. Scan more
 2. Click any signature in Probe Scanner
 3. Copy all (control-a, control-c)
 4. Click Mass Sig Reader in siggy Paste into box (control-v)
 5. Click submit
 6. Watch updates appear in signature list (or not, they'll show up anyway)
 7. Goto step 1

#Wormhole Signatures (found wormhole, wat do?)
If you scan down a wormhole, always bookmark the location and update siggy with as much information about hole as you can, even if you don't jump through to see where it connects to. DO NOT BOOKMARK THE SIGNATURE IN THE PROBE SCANNER WINDOW. Always warp to the hole (at range is fine if you aren't going to jump) and bookmark it by right clicking the hole and saving the location. While you're at the hole, right click it and show information to see the type, age, stability, and size. Edit the signature in siggy and use the dropdown to select the type. Pro-tip: The non-K162 types will tell you exactly the class of system it connects to. If the hole is EOL you must update the connection if you jump, or make a note of it in the comment if you don't jump (e.g. `C5 ? EOL`). After jumping the hole AND BOOKMARKING YOUR WAY BACK HOME edit the connection in the chain map with any details such as EOL, frigate sized, or reduced/crit. Also, update the signature comment with the class and name (e.g. `C5 Fubar`).

A note about the new C13 systems: Siggy appears to not have been fully updated with all the details about these systems. Even if you've got the signature name (e.g. type of gas site) in the scanner window and paste it in, siggy may not update with the name. Also, the wormhole types for C13 connections don't appear in the pulldown list.

tl;dr

* Bookmark the hole, not the signature in the Probe Scanner window
* When you're done, the signature should have the type of hole (K162, E004, etc.) selected in the dropdown and the name in the comments
* Update the connection in the chain map with any extra details (EOL, reduced, frigate-sized, etc.)

#How to be bad
Here are some ways I have seen people be bad at using siggy. Don't do these things.

* Overheard in comms: "I just finished scanning the system, now let me put the info into siggy"
    * WRONG: Put info in as you go! This shares the information with the entire corporation as soon as possible. It also lets multiple people scan a system at the same time as they can see what's already been scanned. You've got a few seconds while the probes warp and scan anyway, so use it to do a quick copy and paste into the tool.
* Pasting from the Probe Scanner into the comments section of the signature in siggy
  * WRONG: I...just....wow.... Read the above about how to use the Mass Sig Reader.
   * Evidently this might have come from a misconception that two or more people updating the same system at the same time might somehow overwrite each other and cause...um...bad things, and such. Which is wrong. Never not use the Mass Sig Reader.
* Jumping through wormholes without updating their signature in siggy
  * WRONG: In siggy you can fill up the chain map by jumping through wormholes without entering a single signature. By adding the details to the signature list we can see which signatures correspond to which wormholes. You get the chain map populated quicker if you skip entering things into siggy, but you have little to no information about the systems you found.

#Final thoughts
If this seems like a lot of bookkeeping and data entry, it is. But the better we can make siggy and our bookmarks look the easier the corp will be able to move around the chain and deal with threats. Take some pride in your work and remember that you're not updating siggy for your own use; you're updating it for the entire corporation to use.
